        An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.
        The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged
        silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths
        decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous
        exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and
        confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:
        pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.

        With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula
        Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish
        meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge
        breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...
        Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen
        table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four
        inches square and look exactly alike.
        
        <b>CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of
        conversation.</b>

        "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse
        me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."

        And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our
        pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...
